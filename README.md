## Magical Potion Brewery Challenge

**Theme: Magical Potion Brewery**

**Entities:**

1. **Wizards**: Users who are magical potion brewers.
2. **Ingredients**: Different magical ingredients required for potion-making.
3. **Potion Recipes**: A collection of potion recipes, each specifying the required ingredients and steps.
4. **Brewery**: The central location where wizards brew potions.

**Functionality:**

1. **Potion Brewing**: Wizards can select a potion recipe and brew potions by combining the necessary ingredients.
2. **Ingredient Management**: Allow wizards to gather and manage their stock of magical ingredients.
3. **Recipe Discovery**: Wizards can discover new potion recipes by experimenting with different ingredient combinations.
4. **Potion Catalog**: Maintain a catalog of all brewed potions, including their properties and effects.
5. **Wizard Profiles**: Allow wizards to create profiles, track their brewing history, and showcase their most powerful potions.
6. **Potion Trading**: Wizards can trade potions with each other, with potion properties affecting trade values.
7. **Leaderboard**: Implement a leaderboard to showcase the most accomplished potion brewers.

**Technologies:**

1. **Kotlin**: As the primary programming language.
2. **Spring Boot**: To build the backend API.
3. **Spring Data JPA**: For managing data related to wizards, ingredients, recipes, and potions.
4. **H2 Database**: To store information about wizards, ingredients, recipes, and potions.
5. **Spring Security**: Handle user authentication and authorization.
6. **JUnit and Mockito**: For unit testing.
7. **Swagger**: To document the API.

**Target Technology/Concept:**

Focus on building a RESTful API using Spring Boot, implementing secure user authentication and authorization for potion brewing and trading operations.

**Project Architecture:**

Build this project as a monolith since it's not overly complex and doesn't require microservices.

**Challenges:**

1. **Dynamic Recipe Discovery**: Create a system for wizards to discover new potion recipes through experimentation.
2. **Potion Properties**: Implement a system for defining and calculating the properties and effects of brewed potions.
3. **Ingredient Management**: Design a way for wizards to gather, trade, and manage their stock of magical ingredients.
4. **Leaderboard Calculation**: Design an efficient algorithm for calculating and updating the leaderboard based on wizards' achievements.
5. **User Authentication**: Implement secure user authentication and authorization for different API endpoints.

This Magical Potion Brewery challenge offers a whimsical and creative theme that combines potion-making, experimentation, and trading within a magical world. Have fun building your Kotlin backend for this enchanting theme!
